## ‚úÖ EASY (25 Questions)

1. Assign a numeric value to a variable and print its value to the console. This helps understand variable assignment and output.  
2. Write a Python program that takes three user inputs for variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, and evaluates the expression `a + b * c`. Observe operator precedence.  
3. Accept three numbers from the user and compute the result of `(a + b) / c`, demonstrating the use of parentheses to override operator precedence.  
4. Raise a number to a given power using the exponentiation operator `**`. For example, calculate `5 ** 3`.  
5. Assign the value `10` simultaneously to two variables using chained assignment (`a = b = 10`), then compare if they refer to the same object using the `is` operator.  
6. Use the `!=` (not equal) operator to compare two string values and print whether they differ.  
7. Accept two integers and check if the first number is greater than or equal to the second number; print the Boolean result.  
8. Compare two strings lexicographically using the less-than operator `<` and print which string is considered "smaller" alphabetically.  
9. Use the logical `and` operator to check if two separate user-defined conditions are both true, and print the combined result.  
10. Use the logical `or` operator to verify if at least one of two conditions is true, and print the result.  
11. Apply the logical `not` operator to a `True` Boolean value and print the inverted result (`False`).  
12. Combine arithmetic evaluation with the `not` operator to negate a condition, such as `not (a > 5 + 3)`.  
13. Use the `in` operator to check if a specific value exists within a predefined list or string.  
14. Use the `not in` operator to verify if a character is absent from a user-entered string.  
15. Use the bitwise left shift operator `<<` to multiply a given number by powers of two, demonstrating how bits shift left.  
16. Use the bitwise right shift operator `>>` to divide a number by powers of two, demonstrating how bits shift right.  
17. Perform a bitwise OR (`|`) operation between two integer values and print the resulting integer.  
18. Perform a bitwise XOR (`^`) operation between two integers and explain the difference with OR and AND operations.  
19. Use the bitwise NOT operator `~` on a number, print the result, and explain the concept of two‚Äôs complement in Python.  
20. Compare two integer variables using the `is` operator to check if they reference the exact same object in memory.  
21. Print the data type of the expression `5 + 5.0` to show how Python handles operations between integers and floats (type promotion).  
22. Modify a variable by chaining assignment operators, for example, increase its value by 3 and then multiply by 2, showing intermediate steps.  
23. Write a Python expression combining all arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`) in one valid line and print the result.  
24. Create two binary numbers using Python literals, apply a bitwise AND (`&`) operation, and print the result in binary format.  
25. Write an arithmetic expression that uses only numbers and parentheses to produce the result `10` without using the number `10` directly.

## üü° MEDIUM (20 Questions)

1. Accept two numeric inputs and evaluate a logical expression combining `and`, `or`, and comparison operators; print the final Boolean result.  
2. Compare three numbers using chained comparison syntax like `a < b == c` and explain how Python evaluates this chain.  
3. Write a program that uses both arithmetic and logical operators in a single expression and prints the output.  
4. Calculate the average score of three tests entered by the user and print whether this average is above 50 (pass/fail).  
5. Rotate the values of three variables (`a`, `b`, and `c`) so that `a` gets `b`‚Äôs value, `b` gets `c`‚Äôs value, and `c` gets `a`‚Äôs value using only one temporary variable.  
6. Evaluate the expression `True + 5 * 2` and print both the numerical result and its data type, explaining the implicit conversion of `True` to `1`.  
7. Accept two numbers and print the results of all six comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) between them.  
8. Perform multiple bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`) on two input integers and print each result clearly labeled.  
9. Accept a word input and check if it is both present in a predefined list and starts with a specific letter, using the `in` and `and` operators.  
10. Ask the user to input a sentence and check if the word `"Python"` (case-sensitive) exists within the sentence.  
11. Accept two strings from the user and compare them for equality while ignoring case sensitivity (case-insensitive comparison).  
12. Assign the same small integer value to two variables and use the `is` operator to check if both variables point to the same memory location.  
13. Convert an integer to its binary representation and print only the last three bits of this binary string.  
14. Construct a calculator-like expression that combines both arithmetic and logical operations and print the final result.  
15. Convert temperature input from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula `F = (C * 9/5) + 32` and print the result.  
16. Accept two Boolean values from the user and print the result of applying `and`, `or`, and `not` operators on these values.  
17. Ask the user for the price and tax percentage, then compute and print the net price after adding the tax.  
18. Accept three side lengths from the user and determine if they can form a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem formula `a¬≤ + b¬≤ == c¬≤`.  
19. Ask the user for a word and check if the letter `'z'` is **not** present in the word, printing a Boolean result.  
20. Use only variables (no hardcoded constants) to build a valid arithmetic expression that results in a specific number, demonstrating variable use.

## üî¥ HARD (7 Questions)

1. Extract the first and last digit of a 3-digit integer using only arithmetic operations (no string conversion) and print both digits.  
2. Convert an integer to binary and access the second-to-last digit of the binary string (bit), printing its value.  
3. Build a single-line boolean expression combining all logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) that returns `True` and explain why.  
4. Accept three numbers and evaluate a complex arithmetic expression with brackets and multiple operators, then print the result.  
5. Write a program that applies and prints the result of **every** comparison operator between two user inputs.  
6. Accept two floating-point numbers with many decimal places and compare them for equality, explaining potential precision issues.  
7. Use the `id()` function to print the memory addresses of two equal integer values and explain whether they refer to the same object or not.
