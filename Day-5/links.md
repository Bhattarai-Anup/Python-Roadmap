# üêç DAY 5: Python Literals, Conditional Statements & Indentation

---

## What You'll Learn Today

In this lesson, we focus on understanding **literals** in Python, which are fixed values like numbers and strings. You will also dive into **conditional statements** (`if`, `else`, `elif`) that allow your program to make decisions. Additionally, you will learn about the importance of **indentation** in Python, which defines the structure and flow of your code. Finally, the session covers the `pass` statement to create placeholders and the `assert` statement used for debugging and enforcing conditions.

## üß† Day 5 Practice Assignments: Basic & Foundational Conditions (Detailed)

### üîπ Easy (1‚Äì10): Basic Condition Checks

1. **Even or Odd Number Check**  
   Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter an integer number.  
   The program should then determine whether the entered number is even or odd by using the modulus operator `%`.  
   Output a clear message indicating whether the number is "Even" or "Odd".

2. **Check if Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero**  
   Create a program that takes a number input from the user and evaluates whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.  
   Use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to distinguish the three cases and print an appropriate message for each.

3. **Divisibility by 5**  
   Ask the user to input a number. Write a program to check if the number is divisible by 5.  
   If yes, print a message like: "The number is divisible by 5." Otherwise, print: "The number is not divisible by 5."

4. **Voting Eligibility Checker**  
   Write a program that takes the age of a person as input.  
   Check if the person is eligible to vote (age should be 18 or older).  
   Print "Eligible to vote" or "Not eligible to vote" accordingly.

5. **Vowel or Consonant Detector**  
   Ask the user to enter a single alphabet letter.  
   Check whether the letter is a vowel (`a, e, i, o, u`) or a consonant.  
   Handle both uppercase and lowercase inputs gracefully and print the result.

6. **Digit or Not Digit Check**  
   Write a program to accept user input and check if the entered value is a digit (0-9).  
   If the input is a digit, print "Input is a digit." Otherwise, print "Input is not a digit."

7. **Number Range Validation**  
   Take a number input from the user.  
   Check if the number lies within the inclusive range from 1 to 100.  
   Print "Number is within the range" if true, else print "Number is outside the range."

8. **Teenager Age Check**  
   Prompt the user to enter their age.  
   Determine if the age falls within the "teenager" range (13 to 19 inclusive).  
   Print "You are a teenager." or "You are not a teenager."

9. **Leap Year Checker**  
   Write a program that asks the user to input a year (integer).  
   Determine if the year is a leap year using the rules:  
   - Year divisible by 4 but not by 100, **or**  
   - Year divisible by 400.  
   Print "Leap year" or "Not a leap year."

10. **Temperature Freezing Point Test**  
    Accept a temperature value (in Celsius) from the user.  
    Check if the temperature is below, above, or exactly at the freezing point (0¬∞C).  
    Print messages accordingly: "Below freezing", "At freezing point", or "Above freezing".

### üî∏ Medium (11‚Äì15): Logical and Combined Conditions

11. **Find the Larger Number**  
    Ask the user to input two numbers.  
    Using conditional statements, determine which number is larger or if they are equal.  
    Print the result clearly, e.g., "First number is larger," "Second number is larger," or "Both numbers are equal."

12. **Divisibility by Both 2 and 7**  
    Write a program to accept a number from the user.  
    Check if the number is divisible by both 2 and 7 simultaneously.  
    Print "Divisible by both 2 and 7" or "Not divisible by both 2 and 7."

13. **Check for Lowercase Vowel**  
    Prompt the user to enter a single letter.  
    Verify if the letter is a lowercase vowel (`a, e, i, o, u`).  
    Use logical `and` and membership operators (`in`) for the condition.  
    Print whether the input is a lowercase vowel or not.

14. **Calculate Overtime Pay**  
    Write a program that asks for the number of hours worked in a week.  
    Assume that any hours above 40 are overtime and paid at 1.5 times the regular rate (assume ‚Çπ100/hour for regular hours).  
    Calculate and print the total pay including overtime.

15. **Basic Login Validation**  
    Simulate a login screen where the user enters a username.  
    Check if the username matches the string `"admin"` (case sensitive).  
    If it matches, print "Login successful"; otherwise, print "Login failed."

### üî∫ Hard (16‚Äì18): Complex Conditions & Applications

16. **Find the Largest of Three Numbers**  
    Accept three different numbers from the user.  
    Using only `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements (no built-in max functions), determine the largest number among the three.  
    Print the largest number with a descriptive message.

17. **Electricity Bill Calculator**  
    Design a program that computes the electricity bill based on the units consumed as input from the user.  
    The billing rates are tiered:  
    - For the first 100 units, charge ‚Çπ5 per unit.  
    - For the next 100 units (101 to 200), charge ‚Çπ8 per unit.  
    - For units beyond 200, charge ‚Çπ10 per unit.  
    Calculate the total amount due based on these slabs and print the detailed breakdown and final bill amount.

18. **Event Entry Eligibility with Multiple Conditions**  
    Write a program that takes a user‚Äôs name and age as input.  
    Allow entry to an event only if:  
    - The age is 18 or above **and**  
    - The name input is not empty or blank.  
    Use compound conditions to enforce these rules.  
    Print "Entry allowed" if both conditions are met, otherwise print "Entry denied" with reasons.

These questions encourage you to write clean, well-structured code while practicing the key concepts of conditionals, logical operators, and input validation. Try testing your solutions with different input scenarios to cover edge cases!
